		<h2>Who are we? <strong>PLACEHOLDER TO TEST VERSION CONTROL</strong></h2>
		Dirty Tactics is a community originating as a Guild from the game World Of Warcraft, it was made by people from a previous guild, who wanted something else. Dirty Tactics is primarly focused around the game, but as more people joined, it became a community.
		for friends and family.<br />
		Today, Dirty Tactics serves as a community for it's people and they have all together made a community which is kind, welcoming and always willing to bring more people into it's arms.
		We strive to provide anyone a nice place to enjoy their evenings, as well as a place to call home.
